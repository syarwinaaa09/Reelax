Reelax is a project aimed at building a modern streaming platform inspired by Hulu.
By utilizing the power of React.js, Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I aim to create an improved version of Hulu, hence the name "Hulu 2.0".

### Features
* **Responsive Design**: Reelax is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones.
* **Next.js**: I leverage the benefits of Next.js, a React framework, to provide server-side rendering, optimized routing and other performance optimization.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Reelax utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to streamline the development process and create a visually appealing user interface.
* **JIT(Just-in-Time) Compilation**: I harness the power of Tailwind CSS 2.1 JIT to optimize my application's CSS generation, resulting in reduced bundle sizes and faster loading times.
